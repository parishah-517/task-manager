# Task Manager in ReactJS

This task manager displays all of the user's current tasks and allows the user to add and delete tasks. 
My implementation prepopulates the task tracker with tasks to show example usage. 

## Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run React dev server (http://localhost:3000)

```
npm start
```

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)

```
npm run server
```

### To build for production

```
npm run build
```
